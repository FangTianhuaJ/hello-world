    "We all familiar with a fact three is always a phase uncertainty in wave function in the study of quantum mechanics. That is to say the wave function $\\psi$ and its phase shift counterpart $\\psi \\prime=e^{i\\phi}\\psi$ describe the same thing (maybe a better word than thing). However, If we inspect deeply we will find  the phase uncertainty existing here is a global phase, for example, the phase shift should not be affected by r and t so its a global phase ,for example, a constant  for most cases. Next we will go further to insect this globle phase which get its professional name - Global $U(1)$ phase symmetry and most important corresponding ramification local $U(1)$ phase symmetry which says the global phase in not a invariant but changes as a function of time and position so it changes locally."
